# FileEncrypterDecrypter

FileEncrypterDecrypter is my first project written entirely in Rust. It is a simple program for encrypting and decrypting files using the XOR method. To make the program more interesting, I added functionality that limits the number of attempts a user has to decrypt a file, based on the userâ€™s local IP address.
